# HACK: We have to use a custom script to invoke tests because we want a
# combined coverage report that includes all packages and go test currently
# doesn't support that. We should monitor golang/go#6909 and golang/go#21126 so
# that we can remove this workaround once that Go toolchain supports this
# natively.
