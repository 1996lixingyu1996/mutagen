# Go-based web application

This directory contains an example [Go](https://golang.org/)-based web
application designed to be developed and run on a cloud-based container host
(though it can also be run locally, e.g. via
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)). It uses
[Mutagen's support for Docker Compose](https://mutagen.io/documentation/orchestration/compose)
to synchronize code from the local filesystem to a shared container volume and
to forward network traffic to the various containerized services, allowing you
to edit code and access the application locally regardless of where the project
is running.


## Usage

This example behaves like any other Composed-based projectâ€”you'll just need to
replace any `docker-compose` command with `mutagen compose`. For more
information and setup, please see the
[documentation](https://mutagen.io/documentation/orchestration/compose).
