Additional IP Rights Grant (Patents)

"This implementation" means the copyrightable works distributed by Google as
part of the Go project.

Google hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to
make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, transfer and otherwise run,
modify and propagate the contents of this implementation of Go, where such
license applies only to those patent claims, both currently owned or controlled
