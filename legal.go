Additional IP Rights Grant (Patents)

"This implementation" means the copyrightable works distributed by Google as
part of the Go project.

Google hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to
make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, transfer and otherwise run,
modify and propagate the contents of this implementation of Go, where such
license applies only to those patent claims, both currently owned or controlled
by Google and acquired in the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily
infringed by this implementation of Go. This grant does not include claims that
would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of this
implementation. If you or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or order or
agree to the institution of patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that this implementation of
Go or any code incorporated within this implementation of Go constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of patent infringement, then
any patent rights granted to you under this License for this implementation of
Go shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
