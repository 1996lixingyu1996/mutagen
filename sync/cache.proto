    // use, and it's a relatively sane implementation based on POSIX mode bits.

    // type and executability bits are really used (or at least necessary) at
    // the moment. It's not clear whether or not we'll eventually need the other
    // permission bits, and it might be possible to get away with a type
    // enumeration instead. This might be easier than trying to replicate
    // FileMode values if moving to another language, though I'm not sure that
    // would be too difficult. But I suppose it's better to just have this
    // additional mode information available for the sake of generality and
    // extensibility. We can always drop it later, but we can't add it back. It
    // may (I'm not exactly sure how) come in useful if we want to implement
    // permission propagation or need a better change detection heuristic. At
    // the moment though, it's highly unlikely that we'll switch away from Go,
    // and I'm willing to live with this slightly "unclean" design, especially
    // given its potential and the relative ease of deprecating it if necessary.
